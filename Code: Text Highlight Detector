"""
This script is an attempt to create a function that will allow a simple text
editor to determine when a passage of text is selected.

This program will print the selected_text only when a passage of text is highlighted. 
The <KeyRelease> event is triggered when a key is released after it has been pressed, 
but since we are binding it to the text widget, it will only be triggered when the 
text widget has the focus and a key is released while the text is selected. If no 
text is selected, the event won't be triggered. So, it will work specifically for 
detecting when text is highlighted.
