"""
After many, many failed attempts to incorporate a Justification button into my
Text Editor program, I restarted from scratch with an attempt to code ONLY the
font toolbar in "Skeleton for Font Styling". After many, many (MANY) more failed 
attempts to incorporate a function that would justify text so that would leave 
both sides of a paragraph flush into my font bar, this is a THIRD project that 
will souly focus on the Justify Text function.

Yes, I am that frustrated.

Once successful, this code will be incorporated into the font toolbar in 
"Skeleton for Font Styling", which will then be incorporated into my basic Text
Editor, and finally, into my Advanced Text Editor.

Bear with me.  I'm still learning.
