Circular Progress Bar

The challenge is to create a circular progress gauge that counts up from 0 to 
100 in Python using the Tkinter library.  Every example of Circular Progress 
Bars I could find on Youtube made use of Pyside or PyQT.  I'm currently teaching
myself Tkinter, and I'm interested in seeing if the same effect can be 
established with plain vanilla Tkinter and some math.
