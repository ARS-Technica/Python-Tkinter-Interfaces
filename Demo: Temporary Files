"""
A demonstration of the correct (safest) way to work with temporary files in 
Python using the tempfile library.

# Create a temporary, randomly named file:

from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile, TemporaryDirectory

with NamedTemporaryFile(prefix="temp_", suffix=".txt") as f:    # Suffix MUST include the dot
    print(f.name)   # Show the path of the newly generated temporary file
    # File name includes the prefix "tmp" (lowercase) by default

    temppath = Path(f.name)
    print(temppath.is_file())   # Should return True

# The tempfile library automatically deletes temporary file after the loop terminates
print(temppath.exists())    # Should return False as the file has been erased


#%%


# Create a temporary, randomly named directory (folder):

from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile, TemporaryDirectory


with TemporaryDirectory() as d:
    print(d)    # Show the path of the newly generated temporary directory
    # Directory name includes the prefix "tmp_" (lowercase) by default

    # Note: d.name is invalid because "d" is a string

    temppath = Path(d)
    print(temppath.is_dir())   # Should return True

# The tempfile library automatically deletes temporary directory after the loop terminates
print(temppath.exists())    # Should return False as the directory has been erased
