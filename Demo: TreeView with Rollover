TreeView with Rollover Effects

Create a two column treeview widget in Python's tkinter library.  The two 
columns should be populated with the key, value pairs of a dictionary 
instantiated at the top of the file.  Style the treeview so that the rows 
backgrounds alternate between white and light grey.  When a user selects one 
of the rows, set that row's background to a light blue.  When a mouse hovers 
over a row, change that row's background a darker grey.
