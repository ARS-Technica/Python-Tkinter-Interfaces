After repeated failures to find a method of reliably justifying text in Tknter's 
text widget, I'm now attempting to create a simple Notepad application in Python 
using the wxPython TextCtrl widget to support justified text alignment through the 
StyleTextCtrl class.  I found this suggestion on Reddit.

Having never used wxPython, this code is going to be a blend of Stackforum code and
ChatGPT suggestions.
